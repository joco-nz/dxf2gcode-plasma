# dxf2gcode-plasma
This is a fork of the DXF2Gcode work from the clever team over on SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxf2gcode/).
Please look there for the official version.

This fork will become more and more focused on the needs of plasma cnc machines and in time could well have the lathe, mill and drag-knife specific features removed.
Given the similarities between beam machines the features added for plasma cnc could be of interest to waterjet or laser machines.  However your mileage may vary as I don't own or have access to those machines so can only really speak to the plasma side of things.
